Clear Function: An "AC" button to clear the entire display.
Delete Function: A "Del" button to delete the last entered character.
Decimal Point: Allows the input of decimal numbers.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes for better usability on various devices.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the calculator layout.
CSS: For styling the calculator interface.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main files:
index.html: The HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
style.css: The CSS file providing the styling for the calculator.

Explanation
HTML: The index.html file contains a form with a text input for the display and several buttons for the calculator functionalities. Each button has an onclick attribute that triggers a JavaScript function to handle the calculator's logic.
CSS: The style.css file styles the calculator to center it on the page, give it a clean look with rounded buttons and a shadow effect for better aesthetics. The display input is styled to look like a traditional calculator display.

Running the Project
Save the index.html and style.css files in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to see and interact with the calculator.

This project demonstrates basic web development skills using HTML and CSS and can be expanded with additional functionality and styling as needed.
